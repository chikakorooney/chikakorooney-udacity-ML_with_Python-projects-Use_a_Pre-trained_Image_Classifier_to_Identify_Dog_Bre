Answer:resnet is more suited.It classified Dog_01.jpg as a golden retriever, and Dog_02.jpy as 'cocker spaniel, english cocker spaniel, cocker', which is closer to golden retriever than 'silky terrier, sydney silky', which vgg has classified Dog_02.jpy as. alexnet has classified Dog_02.jpy as broccoli(!), so I would not choose it.
