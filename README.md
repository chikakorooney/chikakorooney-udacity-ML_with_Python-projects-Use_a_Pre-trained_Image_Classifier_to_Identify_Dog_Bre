# udacity-ML_with_Python-projects-Use_a_Pre-trained_Image_Classifier_to_Identify_Dog_Breeds

I have written a program using pre-defined ML models such as vgg, alexnet and resnet to classify dog breeds from pictures.

Directory structure:

pet_images folder > pictures are saved here which are used to demonstrate how the program works

uploaded_images folder > if you wanted to test your own, to upload photos here

alexnet_pet-images.txt
vgg_pet-images.txt
resnet_pet-images.txt
> theese are the output statistics from running respective models on images in pet_images folder

resnet_uploaded-images.txt
vgg_uploaded-images.txt
alexnet_uploaded-images.txt
> theese are the output statistics from running respective models on images in uploaded_images folder

files ending in .sh > batch files to run the test for three models at the same time

check_images.py > main python file which runs using other .py files.
